# Revenue is vanity, but Profit is sanity." 


## 💸This project is designed for Founders and Executive Leadership to uncover why a company generating $2.0M in Gross Revenue is suffering from stagnant growth. 


I have deep-dived into Unit Economics to identify "Wealth Destroyers."📌 


### 1. Executive SummaryPrimary Objective:
Identify "Profit Leaks" across 10,000+ transactions. Core Insight: Revealed that 18% of potential profit was being consumed by unoptimized shipping routes and high return rates.Target Audience: Founders, CFOs, and Senior Operations Managers.🛠


### 2. The Tech Stack** SQL: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and cleaning transaction-level errors.

**Power BI**: Built an Executive Dark Mode dashboard with DAX-driven business logic.
**Python**: Generated a "messy" realistic dataset with hidden costs (Marketing Spend, Shipping Distance).
**Business Analysis**: Focused on Net Profit Margin and Return-on-Ad-Spend (ROAS).⚙️ 


#### Data Engineering Layer (SQL)Founders value clean data. I used the following SQL logic to transform raw logs into "Business-Ready" insights:
### SQL TRANSFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS:
   * **Fixed -99 System Glitches**
   * **Imputed NULL Marketing Spend**
   * **Calculated Transactional Net Profit**


💡 4. Strategic Insights & "Aha!" Moments

**The Financial Bridge (Waterfall Chart):**

Discovery: Logistics and Refunds are the biggest "Margin Killers."

Highlight: While Marketing gets the blame, Shipping Costs eat more profit.


**Logistics Efficiency (Scatter Plot):**

Discovery: Furniture shipped over 1,200 KM is non-profitable.

Highlight: Every mile beyond this threshold destroys company value.


**Root Cause (Decomposition Tree):**

Discovery: Bookshelves suffer from a 15% higher return rate.

Highlight: High returns create a "Double Shipping" cost that wipes out profits.🚀 


**6. Actionable Recommendations**

Dynamic Shipping: Implement a "Distance Surcharge" for orders over 1,200 KM.

Returnless Refunds: For items under $20, stop paying for return shipping; let the customer keep the item.

Budget Pivot: Re-allocate 10% of spend from Furniture to Electronics to maximize ROI.📈
